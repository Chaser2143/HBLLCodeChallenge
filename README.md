Hey Harold B. Lee Library Software Team!

I hope you enjoy the code I wrote! I did my best to make sure it is all clean and well documented.
I also added some basic data validation on each function.

I ran this code on Python 3.10.2. There are no required imports for these functions.

I wouldn't expect any hiccups in running the code. I originally made a simple fibonacci sequence function, and then thought it'd be more interesting to make one with a cache as well, as it's significantly faster and able to calculate higher terms in the sequence. I put in some timing to validate that the cache worked, and I decided to leave it all incase you wanna play around with it too.

Note: Sometimes the cached timing will say 0.0, I think it's just dropping the decimal places because the number is very small.

Thank you for your time in reviewing my code! I hope you find everything satisfactory and hope to meet you soon!
